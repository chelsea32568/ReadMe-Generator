## Description

When a user uses the terminal and runs 'node index.js' they will be prompted for different answers to a variety of questions

After answering the questions, their input will dynamically generate a README.md file based on their input. 

This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project. 

## Installation

To work on this code copy this SSH key: git@github.com:chelsea32568/ReadMe-Generator.git and paste into your desired folder using Git Bash. Then use git pull to pull the file into your local repository. Make necessary changes and then add changes into the git repository by using git add -A, git commit -m "", git push.
